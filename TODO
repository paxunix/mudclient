- it only operates in line-mode, which is fine, but it should do some of
  the line-mode setup during connection negotiation.  See RFC 1184.  Then
  we can do character echoing (passwords, etc.) properly.  Line-mode-only
  operation means editor-like things on the remote system will be ugly.
- should strip out all ESC sequences, not just ANSI color, on logged lines
- #session to open a connection while in the client
- should page large amounts of output
- it should do the telnet protocol too
- cbreak mode stuff
	- ReadMode 4 - we have to intercept the control flow terminal characters
	  since when a ^Z or ^C is received, we have to play with the ReadMode
	- ^R - redraw current line
	- ^W - erase last word
	- Tab - complete prefix under cursor, searching forward.  Works like
	  in 4DOS...pressing TAB multiple times on a word will cycle through
	  the possible completions for that word.
	- Meta-Tab complete prefix under cursor, searching backward
	- Delete - erase char under cursor
	- Backspace - erase char to left of cursor
	- left arrow - move left one character
	- right arrow - move right one character
	- up arrow - last history command
	- down arrow - next history command
	- Insert - toggle between insertion and overtype mode
- #redraw toggle to automatically redraw the input line when text arrives from
  server.
- would be nice if speedwalking wouldn't spam you off
- use for/vec instead of while/substr to parse for braces.  See DejaNews,
  comp.lang.perl.misc, search for "vec" on 04/03/97
